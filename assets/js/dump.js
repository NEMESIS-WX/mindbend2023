      <p>You have seen a Circus man balancing himself on rope and performing stunts, Ladies
      balancing matki on her head and performing the traditional ghoomar dance in the similar
      manner here the participants have to make a self balancing bot which can balance a ball.
      You have been very well known about the Autonomous Two wheeler self balancing where
      the bot has to travel only on just two wheels and complete the track which will consists of
      various stages having uneven path.      
      </p>
      <h2>
        PROBLEM STATEMENT
      </h2>
      <p>to make a two-wheeler self-balancing line follower bot which has to travel the track
      having various stages and complete the trajectory. The bot must be autonomous which
      can detect the track by itself just by observing the white and black path and complete the
      stages accordingly. 
      </p>
      <h3>ROUND 1</h3>
      <p>In round 1 participants have to balance various numbers of ping pong balls which will be
      kept in the container of the bot and travel the arena having rough surfaces with turns.      
      </p>
      <h3>ROUND 2</h3>
      <p>those teams which qualify round 1 has to now balance a single large ball on its head and
      move along the arena having 3 stages.

      INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>Finding a bug and making a new feature is what all happens when it comes to industrial
    level development. This event is inspired by this nature of programs. This event is divided
    into two rounds. Round 1 will be all about debugging the given problem statement. This
    round tests the debugging, analytical, logical skills of the participants. It will bring out
    those who can clearly see the mistakes and correct them in the best possible manner.
    Round 2 will be on finding the most optimal solution. This round tests the algorithm
    development skills of the participants. Those who will be able to figure out the steps to
    solve and implement it will come out as most skillful of all.
    </p>
    <h2>

    </li>
    <li>Language of Code Snippets - C++
    </li>
    
   </ul>
   <p>This round will consist of 5 problems with increasing difficulty levels A to E. The
    participants will be given the question, code snippets, sample input & output. The code
    will contain errors like syntax errors, logical errors, semantic errors, runtime errors,
    segmentation faults, endless loops etc. Under a time constraint the participants will have
    to debug the given code. The participants have to look for such errors and try to fix as
    many as bugs possible
    </p>
    <h3>ROUND 2:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li> Total no. of questions - 2 (A, B)
    </li>
    <li>Total Duration - 120 minute
    </li>
    <li>Language - Any Language of Choice
    </li></ul>
    <p>This round will consist of 2 problems with increasing difficulty levels A to B. The
    participants will be given the question, sample input & output, input test cases text file.
    The participants will have to formulate a program which can give correct output for
    maximum of the given test cases.

     <h3>JUDGING CRITERION:
     </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Round 1: The code will be judged based on the error corrected and depending on the
        importance of the line on which the error was corrected. If the error is on a line which
        is more important than others then it will be assigned maximum marks.
        </li>
        <li>Round 2: The received codes will be run through the test input cases. The team will
        be scored depending on the no. of inputs for which the code gives the correct output.
        If there is a tie in the scores then the time complexity will be given priority over space
        complexity.

    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>A  Smart  City  stimulation  model  on  tinkercad  or  any  other  equivalent  platform  using
    electronic  devices  such  as  sensors,  microprocessor  and  microcontroller,  or  any  other 
      available  devices.  The  Hi-Tech  city  should  be  using  different  mechanisms  to  serve  the
    society  and  cater  the  needs  of  resources  with  requiring  minimum  human  intervention.
    Participants  will  have  to  demonstrate  various  technologies  to  resolve  the  problems  while
    creating a safe and secure Smart City model. The city can demonstrate different categories
    like township, farm area, power supply along with a good transportation system etc.    
    </p>
    <h2>
      PROBLEM STATEMENT:
    </h2>
    <p>The event will be conducted in 2 rounds. The first one will be the online presentation of the
    idea of smart city model in front of judges. Shortlisted teams will be required to submit the
    simulation circuit of the model on tinkercad.
    </p>
   <h3>ROUND 1: 
   </h3>
   <p>  Online Presentation Round: 
   </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Duration of presentation must not be more than 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Teams need to make a PPT explaining their model.
      </li>
      <li>PPT must include images of their own model.
      </li>
      <li>An overview of their model should be presented during the given time span.
      </li>
      <li>Ensure that all innovative ideas present in your model are included.
      </li>
      <li>Documentation of around 5-6 pages of the work should be submitted.
      </li>
      <li>Any sort of malpractice might lead to disqualification.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>ROUND 2:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>In this round participants need to submit a video of their simulation model on
      tinkercard.
      </li>
      <li>Whatever the specifications given by teams in 1st round they need to make simulation
      on tinkercad.
      </li>
      <li>Teams need to submit the video of simulation within the timelimit in the form link that
      will be provided.
      </li>
      <li>Video should be in mp4 format and maximum time limit is 40 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>Any kind of malpractice will result into disqualification
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        TEAM SPECIFICATIONS
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The team should be of 3 to 5 members.
      </li>
      <li>Members of a team may be from the same college/school or different (K12/UG/PG).
      </li>
      <li>Any number of teams can participate from one college/school.
      </li>
      <li>Professionals are not allowed. Only students can participate.
      </li>
      <li>Participants are required to bring their school/college ID cards.
      </li>
      <li>Once  registered,  the  same  team  cannot  register  with  another  name  or  for  another
      model other than previously registered one.
      </li>
      <li>Every  team  must  have  a  unique  name  that  should  not  be  offensive,  conflicting  or
      inappropriate.
      </li>
      <li>Organizers have the right to reject entries for any inappropriate team name.
      </li>
      <li>Organizers must be notified if a team’s name has been changed
      </li>
      <li>Team Representative: Each team must specify their Team Representative (Leader) at
      the  time  of  registration  on  the  website.  All  important  communications  between  the
      organizer  and  the  registered  teams  will  be  done  through  their  Team  Representative.
      The Team representatives must submit valid contact details (phone no., email id, etc.)
      at the time of registration.
      </li>
      <li>If teams don’t show up on allotted slot, they will be disqualified.
      </li>
    </ul>
