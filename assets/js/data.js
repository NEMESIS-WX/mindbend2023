      <li> The CAD file must be in .sldasm/ .dwg/ .step format. </li>
      <li> Teams  have  to  manufacture  the  same  CAD  model  in  the  next  round,  so  design  it

      noted.</li>
      <li>The structure made with minimum material and holding the maximum weight would 
      be considered the winner.</li>
      <li> The ratio of maximum weight withstand to the weight of the structure itself would be
      the efficiency of the tower </li>
      <li>The aesthetics of the bridge will also be evaluated.</li>
      <li>The judges will evaluate the bridge based on its appearance, the originality of its
      design, and the connection of members.</li>
      <li> The weightage of each criterion is given as follows: Efficiency = 70 points Aesthetics =
      30 points</li>
      <li>The total score will be given out of 100 points. </li>

      Introduction
    </h2>
    
    <p>
    Engineering students are competitive by nature and the notion of competition was an
  appealing approach to capitalize on this characteristic. And therefore, here participants
  have to win with the help of their RC Nitro cars. Students have to Design a remote-
  controlled car consisting of an IC Engine that can compete with other opponents on a dirt
  track full of various types of obstacles.

          INTRODUCTION
        </h2>
        <p>
        Do you maze? Now comes the time to make a robot that is capable of mapping out an unknown maze, mark checkpoints and navigate the shortest possible path through the maze in the least amount of time.
        </p>
        <h2>
          PROBLEM STATEMENT
        </h2>
        <p>
          Participants are required to build an autonomous, self-contained robot, robot, which can get to the center of a maze in the shortest possible time. A robot essentially comprises a drive motor or motors to move it; a steering and turning method; sensors to detect the presence or absence of maze walls; sensors or control logic to oversee the activities of the rest and keep the vehicle 'on track' or to solve the maze; batteries to provide power.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <h3>
            ROUND 1(Online)
          </h3>
          <p>
          It will be an abstract round where participants have to answer how to solve the given maze efficiently after analyzing the given track and submit their response.
          </p>
  
          <h3>
            ROUND  2(Offline)
          </h3>
          <p>
            The robot will be required to follow the path on the arena. The layout of the arena will be disclosed on the spot.
          </p>
          
          <h2>
            Team Specifications
          </h2>
          <ul>
            <li>This will be a team event. You can participate individually or with a team of a maximum of 3 members.</li>
            <li>Any number of candidates can participate from one college/school.</li>
            <li>Participants are required to bring their school/college ID cards.</li>
            <li>Once registered, the same candidate cannot register with another name for the event. Organizers have the right to reject entries for any inappropriate username of the candidate.</li>
            <li>Organizers must be notified if a candidate’s username has been changed.</li>  
          </ul>
          <h2>
            JUDGING CRITERIA
          </h2>
          <ul>
            <li>All contesting machines shall be collected before the maze is unveiled.</li>
            <li>After the maze is unveiled, the mouse handler is given 3 minutes before the start of his/her run to make adjustments (if any) to the mouse sensors and calibrate the sensors.</li>
            <li>Each contesting robot is allocated a total of 5 minutes of access to the maze after the 3 minutes sensor adjustment time. The maze-time clock will commence after the expiry of the 3 minutes time limit even if the handler is still making adjustments to the sensors.</li>
            <li>The time taken to travel from the start square to the destination square is called the "run" time. Traveling from the destination square back to the start square is not considered a run. The total time taken from the first activation (after calibration is done or calibration time is over, whichever is less) of the micro mouse until the start of each run is also measured. This is called the ‘maze’ or 'search' time. If the micro mouse requires any manual assistance at any time during the contest, it is considered "touched." Scoring is based on these three parameters.</li>
            <li>A contestant should not feed information on the maze to the micro mouse. Therefore, changing ROMs or downloading programs is NOT allowed once the maze is revealed. However, contestants are allowed to:</li>
            <li>➔ Replace batteries between runs</li>
            <li>➔ Adjust sensors (gain, position, etc.) ➔ Change speed settings</li>
            <li>The contestants should be prepared with the circuit diagrams, algorithms, and code listings to convince the judges that any alteration they do in the total 5 minutes span does not add topological information about the maze to the mouse.</li>
            <li>Participants are allowed to restart once and suitable penalty will be added.</li>
          </ul>

            <li>A robot shall be self-contained. It shall not use an energy source employing a combustion process.</li>
            <li>A robot should be such that it fits between the given wall specifications.</li>
            <li>The method of propulsion is at the discretion of the builder, provided that the power source is non-polluting and should not harm the arena.</li>
            <li>A robot shall not leave anything behind while negotiating the maze.</li>
            <li>A robot shall not jump over, climb, scratch, damage or destroy the walls of the maze.</li>

          INTRODUCTION
        </h2>
        <p>
          Most of us have learned projectile motion in class 11. So now it's time to apply that knowledge in real life. So, here we cat-a-pult to all physics those enthusiasts, where they will build a catapult not just for distance but most importantly for accuracy. Rounds of this event are planned based on this year's theme of mindbend. Get ready with your amazing catapult to conquer the enemy region!!      
        </p>
        <h2>
          PROBLEM STATEMENT
        </h2>
        <p>
          Participants have to design an object-throwing mechanism.

        <ul>
          <h3>
            ROUND 1(Smash the Enemy)
          </h3>
          <p>
            In this round, participants must target the enemy regions and throw the object into their area. The more you can go into the area, the more points you get. According to the points scored, a specific number of participants will qualify for round 1. Participants have to smash four enemies in a single chance. All areas must be hit once during your round with in Time limit of 3mins.
          </p>
  
          <h3>
            ROUND  2(Conquer)
          </h3>
          <p>
            Participants have to attack the targets in a specific time limit. The more targets hit, the more you score. Any number of balls can be used within the given time limit of 5 mins. This round will also test your model’s precision and accuracy.

          INTRODUCTION
        </h2>
        <p>
        The Chem-E Car is a competition in which engineering undergraduate students are challenged to design and build a shoebox-sized car that is powered and stopped by chemical processes. The car does not compete in a race, but rather in an accuracy test. The car moves and stops at a set distance using controlled chemical processes. The winning automobile is the one that comes the closest to hitting the target solely based on chemistry.

            The teams have to run their working models on the specified tract and execute the stopping mechanism for a specified distance. All the teams will be judged on the basis of how close their car gets to the endline in a specific amount of time and winners will be decided on this basis. The judges’ decision will be final on all matters.
